# Algorithms Basics

An **algorithm** is a well-defined sequence of computational steps that transforms an input into an output.

## 1. Characteristics of an Algorithm
For a set of instructions to be called an algorithm, it should satisfy the following criteria:
- **Input**: Zero or more well-defined inputs.
- **Output**: At least one well-defined output.
- **Definiteness**: Each step must be clear and unambiguous.
- **Finiteness**: The algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps.
- **Effectiveness**: Each step must be basic enough to be carried out exactly.

## 2. Why do we need Algorithms?
- **Scalability**: As the size of data grows, we need efficient ways to process it.
- **Efficiency**: Algorithms help us minimize time and memory usage.
- **Correctness**: They provide a reliable path to the correct solution.

## 3. How to Analyze an Algorithm?
Algorithms are typically analyzed based on:
1.  **Time Complexity**: Total time taken by the algorithm as a function of the input size ($n$).
2.  **Space Complexity**: Total memory space required by the algorithm during its execution.

## 4. Typical Algorithm Design Patterns
- **Brute Force**: Trying every possible combination.
- **Divide and Conquer**: Breaking the problem into smaller sub-problems.
- **Greedy**: Making the locally optimal choice at each step.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Storing results of sub-problems to avoid redundant work.

> A "good" algorithm is one that provides the correct result using minimal resources (time and memory).
